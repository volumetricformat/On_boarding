## About Issues
You can collect user feedback, report software bugs, and organize tasks you'd like to accomplish with issues in a repository. Issues can act as more than just a place to report software bugs.

Other conversations are more suitable for discussions. You can use discussions to ask and answer questions, share information, make announcements, and conduct or participate in conversations about a project. 

## Creating an Issue
  - Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests.
  - People with read permissions can create an issue in a repository where issues are enabled.
  - You can open a new issue based on code from an existing pull request.
