## Getting Help from the Staff

- Standards Hub staff serves a number of other clients.  No one person is assigned exclusively to VFA. 
- Standards organizations generate a staggering amount of email. Most decisions are made during email debates that span 4 - 6 conversation.  Most of the threads do not come to a specific, agreed solution and serve primarily as discussion threads.  
- Members should not expect that staff members will be able to read all the thread and figure out what parts are discussion and what parts are decisions.  
- The most reliable way to ensure that a decision that requires staff follow up is to send the final consensus to the helpdesk@volumetricformat.org email domain.  
- The entire staff sees those emails and will act most efficiently on the request. 
- Tell us what you want, when you need it, and who to inform when we are done. 
- Sending to the helpdesk@volumetricformat.org will reduce the likelihood we miss something.  Specific instructions from the members will help ensure we take care of the need accurately.

### Tools Proliferation

- Members of the Standards Groups all have their favorite applications and often want to adopt them as part of their workflow.
- Standards Hub provides VFA a set of tools that should be capable of supporting all of the basic functions of creating and administering a specification development environment.
- As a staff, we cannot adopt everything the WGs might want to use.  Tools proliferation can create orphan content that might not support the VFA privacy and IPR rules.
- If you have an idea, ask the Standards Hub Staff.  We do this for a living and we may know of tools that can perform the functions you need.
