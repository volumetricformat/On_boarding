## Add a File

Unless you have the right permission, you won’t be able to upload a file directly to the VFA repository. 
These are the possible options:

### A. Create an empty file as a placeholder, then copy and paste the content into the new file

1. Choose a branch and click **Create new file**
1. Complete file name, title, content & description
1. Click **Propose new file**
1. Click **Create a pull request**
```Note: Make sure that you choose the correct destination branch```
1. Select the recently created Pull Request
1. Select the tab Files changed and click in **(…)** and then click **Edit File**
1. Copy and paste content

### B. Add a File – Use your Personal GitHub Client (Desktop)

1. GitHub Desktop
     It is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub.com from your desktop
     There are multiple apps. GitHub Desktop is simple, free and it can be downloaded from 
     [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop).
1. Personal GitHub.com account
     If you have a GitHub account, you have one, check https://github.com/<your-user-mame>
     Here you will find all the repositories that you have forked
1. Working Directory
     You clone repositories to your hard drive
     Please remember to store them in a folder that it is not synced with the cloud. You may have problems otherwise; this is because each time that you change from branch to branch the content in the folder changes.
1. Visual Studio Code
     There are multiple editors, Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor,  which features will 
     assist you in your editing work. It can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

You can select any of the forked repos, clone, create new or add existing ones
The tool will automatically fork a repo if you start a Pull Request in a repo where you don’t have write access.

  - **Changes (tab)** From here you can decide how you are going to work with the files: using an external editor, open them in your Finder or Explorer or in GitHub
  - **History (tab)** All the changes applied to the repo
  - **Current Branch**
  - **Origin** Normally it refers to repos in your Personal GitHub.com account 
  - **Upstream** Normally it refers to repos in OMP GitHub.com account
  - **Fork** When a repo in OMP GitHub.com account is copied to your Personal GitHub.com account
  - **Clone** When a repo is copied to the working directory in your laptop (local)
