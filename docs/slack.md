## Slack Introduction

Slack Connect is a faster way to work with people from outside your company. With Slack Connect you’re able to save time by bringing everyone you work with into one place—no more switching between different tools.

1. Create the channel: Click the + button next to Channels in your sidebar. Name the channel, check the box to share the channel outside your organization, and click Create.
2. Send the invite: Invite your partner right from Slack, or copy the link provided and email the invite directly.
3. Wait for your partner: After they click the link, they'll be taken back to Slack to accept and set up the channel on their end.
4. Get admin approval: Depending on your settings, the invitation will be sent to an admin or both teams for approval.

## Best practices

 - Ensure that conversations don’t stray to other platforms. Let’s commit to using Slack for informal quick messages only.
 - Invite your teammates to join you on Slack. Make sure everyone involved in the project is invited to your organization’s Slack and added to our channel(s).
